The solution depends on the specific library and error. It usually involves one of the following:

1. **Update the Third-Party Library:** Check for newer versions of the library that are compatible with your React Native version. Updating to the latest version often resolves compatibility problems. 

2. **Use a Compatible Alternative:** If updating is not possible, explore alternative libraries that provide similar functionality and are known to be compatible with your React Native setup.

3. **Adapt to the Newer API:** If updating or replacing the library isn't feasible, examine the library's documentation or source code to understand how to adapt its usage to the current React Native native modules API. This usually involves changes to how you import, initialize and interact with the module.  Refer to the React Native documentation for information on the latest native module APIs.
